## Data Analysis and Visualisation

Suicides are increasing day by day everywhere. So, here are some analysis of statistics of suicides in different countries across the world. : [Suicide analysis](https://github.com/nikhilmalkari/data_science_projects/blob/master/suicideanalysis.ipynb)

Cricket WorldCup 2019 is a huge tournament. Before the start of tournament here are some analysis which will be useful to know which team is favourites for this tournament and which players to watch out : [Worldcup2019](https://github.com/nikhilmalkari/data_science_projects/blob/master/worldcup2019.ipynb)

There is water scarcity in India a lot. So here is the information of availabilty of water in India is provided : [Analysis of availabilty of water in India](https://github.com/nikhilmalkari/data_science_projects/blob/master/eda_water_analysis.ipynb)

General information about each states is observed : [Indian states](https://github.com/nikhilmalkari/data_science_projects/blob/master/kernel8151963c97.ipynb)
